        "summary": "Law 1: This law details the requirements for the playing surface, which must be either wholly natural or, if competition rules permit, wholly artificial, with artificial surfaces being green and meeting the FIFA Quality Programme standards for representative and international matches [1, 2]. The field must be rectangular with marked boundary lines including touchlines and goal lines, a halfway line, and a center circle [2, 3]. The field's dimensions vary, but the touchline must be longer than the goal line, with specific minimum and maximum lengths [4]. International matches have specific size requirements [5]. The goal area and penalty area are defined by specific measurements from the goalposts [5, 6]. There is also a corner area, and the corner flagposts are compulsory and must be at least 1.5 m high with a non-pointed top [7]. Technical areas are designated for team officials and substitutes, with markings and rules for behavior within them [8]. Goals must be placed in the center of each goal line, and they consist of two vertical posts and a horizontal crossbar [9]. The distance between the posts is 7.32 m (8 yds) and the distance from the crossbar to the ground is 2.44 m (8 ft). Goal line technology (GLT) can be used if stipulated in competition rules to verify if a goal has been scored, with the GLT indication being sent to the match officials, potentially via the referee's earpiece/headset [10-12]. Commercial advertising and logos are not permitted on the field of play, goal nets, technical area or referee review area (RRA) during playing time [13, 14].",

Balls used in official competitions must meet the FIFA Quality Programme requirements [16]. No commercial advertising is permitted on the ball except for the logo of the competition, the organizer, and the manufacturer’s trademark [17]. If a ball becomes defective, play stops and restarts with a dropped ball, or if it becomes defective at a restart, the restart is retaken [17, 18]. Additional balls can be placed around the field of play, under the referee's control [18].",

        "summary": "Law 3: A match is played between two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players, one of whom must be the goalkeeper, and the game cannot start or continue if either team has fewer than seven players [19]. The number of substitutes allowed is determined by the governing bodies of the competition, up to a maximum of five, with a maximum of three substitution opportunities in official competitions, in addition to substitutions at half-time [20, 21]. In extra time, teams may use unused substitutes and substitution opportunities [21, 22]. Competitions can also permit additional permanent concussion substitutions which do not count against the total number of allowed substitutions [23, 24]. The substitution procedure requires the referee to be informed before any substitution [25, 26]. Players may change places with the goalkeeper with the referee's permission during a stoppage in play [27]. Players sent off before the match can be replaced by a named substitute, but if sent off after the kick-off, they cannot be replaced [28]. Each team must have a captain who wears an identifying armband [29, 30]. Anyone not named on the team list as a player, substitute or team official is an outside agent. If and only if the outside agent inteferes with play, then play is stopped and restarted with a dropped ball. If a ball is going into the goal and the interference does not prevent a defending player playing the ball, the goal is awarded if the ball enters the goal (even if contact was made with the ball) unless the interference was by the attacking team. If a player re-enters the field without the referee’s permission, the referee must stop play (unless the player does not interfere with play or if advantage can be applied) and caution the player. If play is stopped, it should be restarted with a direct free kick from the position of the interference or with an indirect free kick from the position of the ball if there was no interference. If a goal is scored and the referee realizes before play restarts that an extra person interfered with the play, the referee must disallow the goal if the extra person was from the scoring team (player, substitute, or team official) or an outside agent who interfered, restarting play with a direct free kick or a dropped ball. However, if the extra person was from the conceding team or an outside agent who didn't interfere, the goal stands. In all cases, the extra person must be removed from the field. If the goal is scored and play has already restarted, the goal cannot be disallowed, but play must be stopped to remove the extra person, and then restarted with a dropped ball or free kick. The referee must also report the incident.",

The compulsory equipment for players includes a shirt, shorts, socks, shinguards, and footwear [31]. Players are responsible for the size and suitability of their shinguards [30, 32, 33]. The captain must wear an armband issued by the relevant competition organizer or a simple, single-colored armband with the word 'captain' or the letter 'C', which must conform to the laws regarding slogans and statements [34]. Electronic communication devices are prohibited for players, though team officials may use small mobile equipment for player welfare or tactical reasons [35]. Equipment must not have political, religious, or personal slogans, statements, or images [36]. Players must not reveal undergarments with such content [36, 37].

They can allow play to continue using advantage or take disciplinary action against players or team officials for misconduct [42, 43]. Referees can show yellow cards for cautionable offenses or red cards for sending-off offenses, and where competition rules permit, can temporarily dismiss a player [43, 44]. The referee must stop play for serious injuries and ensure players who are bleeding leave the field of play [45, 46]. A referee may be assisted by a video assistant referee (VAR) only for clear and obvious errors related to goals, penalties, direct red cards, and mistaken identity [47].

Assistant referees indicate when the ball is out of play, when a player may be offside, and when substitutions are requested [54, 55].

For a kick-off, all players, except the kicker, must be in their own half, and opponents must be 9.15 m from the ball until it is in play [60]. A goal can be scored directly from the kick-off, but if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, it results in a corner kick for the opponents [60]. If the kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick, or for a handball offense, a direct free kick is awarded [61]. For a dropped ball, the ball is dropped for the defending team goalkeeper in their penalty area if the ball was in or last touched in the penalty area and in all other cases the ball is dropped for a player of the team that last touched the ball at the point of last touch [61, 62].",

During penalties (penalty shoot-out), the relevant Laws apply, and players sent off during the match cannot participate [65]. The referee tosses a coin to determine the goal at which kicks are taken and the order of kicks [66]. Only players on the field at the end of the match are eligible to take kicks, and a team must have an equal number of penalty takers when the shoot-out starts.

A player in an offside position who interferes with play, interferes with an opponent, or gains an advantage by playing the ball/interfering with an opponent when it has, rebounded or been deflected off the goalpost, crossbar, match official or an opponent OR has been deliberately saved by any opponent [69]. A defending player who leaves the field without the referee's permission is considered on the goal or touchline until the next stoppage or the defending team plays the ball towards the halfway line [70]. An attacking player may step off the field to avoid being in play, but can be considered on the goal line if they reenter and get involved in play [70].

The same applies for holding, impeding with contact, biting, spitting, throwing objects, or a handball offense (except for a goalkeeper within their penalty area) [71, 72]. A handball offense occurs when a player deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, or makes their body unnaturally bigger [73]. Indirect free kicks are awarded for playing in a dangerous manner, impeding an opponent without contact, dissent, verbal offenses, and tricking the goalkeeper [74, 75]. Goalkeepers cannot handle the ball for more than six seconds (6 seconds), touch the ball with their hands after deliberately kicking it or from a teammate’s throw-in, from a teammate's backpass with their foot or waste time [75]. The referee can take disciplinary action from entering the field for pre-match inspection until leaving after the match [76]. The yellow card signals a caution and the red card signals a sending-off [77]. Delaying the restart to show a card is allowed, except for a quick free kick situation [78]. Cautionable offenses include delaying play, dissent, entering without permission, not respecting required distance, persistent offenses, unsporting behavior, entering the referee review area (RRA) or excessively using the 'review' signal [79]. Players are sent off for serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, biting, DOGSO fouls, using offensive language, or receiving a second yellow card [80-82]. Players must be cautioned for unsporting behavior, including simulation, reckless fouls, deliberate handballs to stop an attack or score, interfering with play after leaving the field, unauthorized field markings, verbal distractions, and trick passes to the goalkeeper. Cautions also apply for stopping a promising attack (except in the penalty area where an attempt to play the ball was made), excessive goal celebrations, provocative gestures, climbing fences, covering the head with a mask or shirt, and removing the shirt, even if the goal is disallowed.",
