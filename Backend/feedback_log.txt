Question: attacker dives in the penalty area with minimal contact, what is the correct decision'

Response: **SUMMARY:** According to Law 12, a penalty kick is awarded for a direct free kick offense committed by a defender inside their penalty area. However, if the attacker dives with minimal contact and there is no clear foul, the referee must determine if the dive constitutes simulation.

**SANCTIONS:** If the referee determines that the attacker has simulated a foul (dived), a yellow card for unsporting behavior should be issued. If there is no foul committed by the defender, no penalty kick should be awarded.

**RESTART:** If a penalty kick is not awarded due to simulation, the restart should be an indirect free kick for the defending team from the spot where the simulation occurred.

**FINAL DECISION:** The referee should not award a penalty kick, issue a yellow card to the attacker for simulation, and restart the game with an indirect free kick for the defending team.
